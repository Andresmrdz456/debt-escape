# DEBT ESCAPE 💸
This is a public accountability project to track my journey toward becoming debt-free by the end of 2025.

## 🎯 Goals
- Pay off all personal and interest-bearing debts
- Maintain monthly budgeting and financial discipline
- Document lessons learned and share tools I build

## 📈 Debt Strategy
I’m using a hybrid Avalanche/Snowball method with a monthly progress tracker.

## 📁 What’s Inside
- `data/` – My monthly debt and budget logs (anonymized)
- `notebooks/` – Exploratory data analysis of debt trends
- `src/` – Python scripts for debt payoff simulation and budget tracking
- `dashboards/` – Visual tools for monitoring progress
- `docs/` – My roadmap and personal updates

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly
- Streamlit (for dashboard)
- Git/GitHub for version control

## 🚀 Follow My Journey
I’ll be updating this repo every month with progress reports and any new tools or learnings. Feel free to fork, watch, or contribute ideas!
